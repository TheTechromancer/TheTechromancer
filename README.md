![BBOT](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=blacklanternsecurity&repo=bbot&theme=dark&show_icons=true)
[BBOT](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/bbot) (Bighuge BLS OSINT Tool) is a swiss army knife for OSINT and bug bounties. Thanks to its recursion it is the most effective subdomain enumeration tool available (I periodically [benchmark it](https://blog.blacklanternsecurity.com/p/subdomain-enumeration-tool-face-off-4e5) to make sure). It was inspired by Spiderfoot but is much faster and supports multiple targets. It was a lot of fun to write and I am still constantly adding modules to it.

![trevorspray](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=blacklanternsecurity&repo=trevorspray&theme=dark&show_icons=true) [TrevorSpray](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/trevorspray) is a password spraying tool armed with a suite of MFA bypasses and a clever IPv6 proxy that lets you load-balance your logins between billions of different source IP addresses.

![manspider](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=blacklanternsecurity&repo=manspider&theme=dark&show_icons=true)
[Manspider](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/manspider) will recursively crawl SMB shares for goodies. It can search by file name, extension, or content (and can read text inside PDFs, msoffice documents, and even images). Basically, it is `grep -R` for the entire network.

![writehat](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=blacklanternsecurity&repo=writehat&theme=dark&show_icons=true)
[WriteHat](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/writehat) was born out of frustration with Microsoft word for pentest report writing. It has a nice report-building interface and allows you to write in markdown and render straight to html/PDF.
